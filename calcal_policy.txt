We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data in our app. 
As a simple calorie tracking tool, we prioritize local storage and minimal data handling.

-----------------------------  Information We Collect ----------------------------- 
We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our servers. All information you enter, such as your BMI details (age, height, weight, gender), 
meal logs, exercise entries, and calorie goals, is saved locally on your device. No internet connection is required for core features, and we never access your camera, 
location, or other device data beyond what's needed for food scanning.

-----------------------------  How We Use Your Information ----------------------------- 
Your data stays on your device to power app features like BMI calculations, meal tracking, and exercise recommendations based on MET values. We use it solely 
to provide a personalized experience. No analytics, ads, or third-party sharing.

-----------------------------  Sharing Your Information ----------------------------- 
We do not share, sell, or disclose any data with third parties. Everything remains private on your phone. If you delete the app or clear storage, all data is erased.
